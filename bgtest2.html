  Hello
  I have failed over and over again at being able to create material or a website that clearly articulates what Crema is and does and why I am proud to see my team grow wildly successful products for our clients.

We have grown from my freelance work ten years ago as a user experience designer to a full stack digital agency twenty plus and growing. We’ve hired user interface and product designers that continue to design incredible products. We’ve hired developers and engineers that can build just about anything with the right resources and time. We’ve hired project managers that can navigate the toughest schedules and biggest outcomes. We’ve hired strategist, that act like a co-founder for hire. They can take just an idea and boil it down into a true product vision with our clients and production team in the course of days.

“You guys do amazing work!……… But what do you actually do?”
I can’t tell you how many times we’ve heard this. Especially after handing someone a business card or someone looks at our website for the first time. Most of our clients could tell you “Crema helped us design an awesome app experience. They built the entire thing!” or “they are amazing at working with our team to pull it all together!” “.. they pushed me to think through the business model, and helped test our ideas, and oh yea, they help interview and train our first hires to this team.”

Context is everything
Today we say, “Crema is an innovation and technology firm.” This was after many other approaches of the years. (see down below for few) Each person comes to our content with a different context. Launched a tech product before? You get how design, development, and business must align. Inside a large old-school IT driven enterprise? You might wonder if that means that we offer IT resources to manage servers. In sales? You might think that we are a creative digital communications firm to build your next landing page. If you’re most of my family, then you think that means you do computers, and can help trouble shoot your iphone photos app.

In person, we’re gold!
Give me five minutes and I can talk anyone through the story of Crema. I tweak the language a bit each time, but the plot line is pretty much the same. In meetings it usually goes something like this:


Share your story with us
I always lead first with the person telling us about their company. About the challenges, they are facing and ideas they have around how technology might be a useful tool for them. We talk through what they’ve tried so far. Have they used another team? Did they hit their outcomes or timelines? Do they have a group in-house? How backlogged is that group? What technologies have they tried? Have they found any off-the-shelf solutions? Etc. At this point, many of them think we do something with apps, but they are not exactly sure what or how.

“Tell me about Crema!” they often turn it back to us.

I’d be happy to. Long story short (but actually long)
I started Crema as a design agency about 8 years ago with my business partner Dan. My skills were in user experience design and product discovery, and Dan offered project management and operations. To this day, our heart-beat is still rooted in great design and management, but we have grown to be a full-stack digital product agency. We started to refer away the marketing and communication projects a few years back in an effort to focus on building products for both funded entrepreneurs and as an innovation partner to large enterprises.

People come through one of three doors when they learn about Crema.

They know Crema for our design. They were told we design incredible user interfaces. That we can design fast and that we are one of the top digital design shops they know.


More often than not, they think of Crema as a dev shop. We build apps and websites. We have people that can code things, if they are pretty savvy they might know we do it with open-source solutions.

Finally, they might think of us as a technology and business consultants. Seeking our feedback on their tech idea or on a current challenge that they have with current technology solution.


Our Approach
Out of the gate, we help companies to align around what problem they are solving, name the customer and users, and then prototype solutions to validate a direction. We explore new ideas or help to bring a fresh perspective on existing ideas.

All engagements kick off with a strategy session and rapid design prototyping sprints. We have full design mockups in the course of days, not weeks, to start putting in front of users and customers to gather feedback and refine our directions.

Our teams move through agile sprints trying to release a build as early as the first sprint. Which often surprises clients when they see themselves holding even a simple build in the first couple weeks of development. All this is so that you can see your solution faster and make an informed decision about how constraints and user feedback will change how we move forward.

We work to a get a release out to users in the first three months. Controlling how fast we release and gathering feedback. As we iterate, our goal is to grow traction and automate what we are doing manually today. Constantly looking to make the experience better, and listen to the customers as we aim for our client’s metrics.


The journey is not a project. It’s a company. We help our clients scale their solutions until the product needs a full-time in-house dedicated team. Together we transition by helping out client interview and hire their developers and designers. We work alongside them as we train them on our architecture, design systems, and long-term considerations.

Often our clients keep us on retainer to help with strategy, design, and management, and we spin our teams back up to test new ideas and concepts as their teams grow.

Some of the companies we have collaborated with have gone on to be wildly successful. Startups we’ve help launch are worth millions even reaching “unicorn” status as billion dollar companies. To make it very clear: we were only one part of that journey. Product is not the only factor to success. Enterprises that we’ve worked with have grown their platforms to have tens of thousands of users, and used our tools to aid multi-million dollar contracts.

Many of our clients have us as silent partners. It’s their success stories. We don’t win awards for their latest ad campaigns. We don’t brag about their SEO vanity stats. We focus on product, and build incredible experiences that help companies grow value for their teams and for the customers

I’ve built one of the most incredible teams I’ve ever seen. We have little to no turnover even with most of the recruiters around attempting to poach.


Our clients are completely integrated and have full transparency to their team. They know most of them personally. We are your product team. Like a startup team for hire. Want to talk to some of our references? They’ll tell you that we challenged them. That we were honest, and that we do our best to help them succeed.

Not everyone succeeds. That’s the nature of business. We know product, and product experience. We partner and consult for customer growth, change management, marketing and growth hacking. We know that we have a lot to learn, but my team learns fast.

Ready to see your product idea become a great product experience?

So how do I boil all that into a tagline?
We have tried many different approaches here. I know what motivates our internal team. “We turn good ideas into great product experiences.”

What are the statements that help you understand who we are. To help you to understand that we are a creative product agency with a heart-beat for creating amazing product experiences.

A few statements we’ve tried.
Your startup team for hire.
We design, build and launch tech products.
We are a technology and innovation firm.
We build custom software with local teams that become successful companies.
We craft great product experiences.
We build incredible product teams.
We help funded startups and innovative enterprises
